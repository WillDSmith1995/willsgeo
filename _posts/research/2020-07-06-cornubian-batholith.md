# Overview
  
<ul> Since growing up in Cornwall, I have had the opportunity to see many of Cornwall's coasts, coves, and beaches, climb many of the tors on Dartmoor, Bodmin Moor, and the other granite stocks, and visit many of the legacy and active mines that occur all over the southwest. It is for this reason I chose geology for further studies. The geology of Cornwall is perhaps some of the best known geology in the world, being studied and mined for 100s of years. A great article on the Cornish mining legacy can be found <a id="raw-url" href="https://www.cornwallheritagetrust.org/timeline/industry-in-cornwall/">here</a>.</ul>

<ul> In academic studies, my masters project was focused on disentagling bimodal granite petrogenesis in the <a id="raw-url" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornubian_batholith">Cornubian Batholith</a> (<em>Figure 1</em>) and assess the implication this may have for W-Sn-Cu mineralisation. Through this project, I have worked with companies operating on W-Sn-Cu and china clay projects and still have strong ties with Cornish operations.</ul>

## Granite petrogenesis
  
<ul>Granite stocks across southwest England have played a significant role in the genesis of world-class polymetallic
mineralisation. In a study <a id="raw-url" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024493719301252?casa_token=1z0rqJxqGEoAAAAA:o1hfZYCTUGDBS9OS-jGe9aYFWMAMKrjjanf7nc4ydA7CtpWkPxj9vf5kaRLGu5nTrOqAXxzfiA">published in 2019</a>, we present the first geochemical and geochronological dataset for the composite Crownhill stock, placing it into the newly emerging geochronological framework for the Cornubian Batholith. The Crownhill stock comprises two-mica granite in the north and biotite granite in the south that encloses pods of tourmaline granite. High-resolution geochronology indicated two-phase magmatism (<em>Figure 2</em>), where zircon cores yield 288.9 &plusmn; 5 Ma and 286.4 &plusmn; 5 Ma and rims yield 277.74 &plusmn; 0.33 Ma and 278.35 &plusmn; 0.35 Ma, for biotite and tourmaline granite, respectively. The zircon cores crystallised during initial magmatism, that formed the two-mica and muscovite granites (Carnmenellis, Bodmin, and Hemerdon) exposed in the north of the Crownhill stock. The zircon rims crystallised from the second phase of magmatism that formed the biotite and tourmaline granites (Dartmoor and St. Austell). This indicates that zircon crystals were assimilated from older two-mica and muscovite granites and entrained in the second phase of magmatism. Trace element compositions of zircon grains suggest that the rims crystallised from a more evolved magma, where zircon grains hosted in tourmaline granites are broadly more evolved than those from biotite granites.</ul>

## W-Sn-Cu mineralisation
  
<ul>Granite plutons and stocks of the Cornubian Batholith are known for world-class W-Sn mineralisation, which typically manifests itself as greisen-bordered stockworks (such as Hemerdon and Cligga Head) or as polymetallic lode systems that protrude from granites (such as those in the Camborne-Redruth area and Redmoor). Whilst in production, I was part of a geological team working on deciphering the formation of the Hemerdon tungsten project (Drakelands Mine) located in the south of the Dartmoor pluton. This is a world-class tungsten (W) deposit that has a completex structural history. As part of this team, I was involved in conducting optical and electron microscopy. It is my hope that this project regains support, bringing back job and research opportunities.</ul>
  
<ul>Ongoing exploration at the A study <a id="raw-url" href="https://www.cornwallresources.com/the-redmoor-project">Redmoor project</a> has discovered W-Sn-Cu mineralisation in polymetallic lodes protruding from the Kithill granite, Callington. The polymetallic lodes actually run underneath my childhood home! The veins formed from when minerlising fluids were expelled from the cooling Kithill granite, and exploited structures present in the host rocks (or 'killas'). Several veins are present in this area, yet the bulk of exploration is focussed at the Sheeted Vein Sytem (SVS). Readers are referred to the link above for details on the Redmoor prospect direct from the source!</ul>

<ul>I completed a summer internship as a junior exploration geologist with Cornwall Resources (the company managing the exploration on site), where I conducted primarily drill-core logging. I was able to observe first-hand how drilling projects are organised, how drill-hole locations are selected, and how drilling results are interpreseted using 3D spatial modelling software. From an academic perspective, I had co-supervised masters projects focussed on characterising and dating the mineralised lode systems. These projects involved optical and electron microscopy, U-Pb zircon geochronology, SEM-EDS mineral chemistry, XRF and LA-ICP-MS, and lead isotopic analyses via MC-ICP-MS. The aim of this work is to update the mineral paragenesis of the lode systems, evaluate the ore-forming processess leading to mineralisation, assess the deportment of chalcophile and siderophile elements in magmatic-hydrothermal fluids, geochemically and isotopically constrain different lode veins in the SW, and directly date lode systems.</ul>
