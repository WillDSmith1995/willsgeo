  # Summary
  
<ul> This presentation describes high-resolution element maps and electron
back scatter diffraction (EBSD) data acquired from the Merensky Reef, Boulder
Bed, and Mottled anorthosites from the western lobe of the Bushveld Complex. We
describe a possible connection between the units and outline considerations
for future petrogenetic models. This talk was presented at the virtual 2022 Platinum
Symposium.</ul>
