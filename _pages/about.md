I am a geologist currently reading for a PhD in exploration geology at the [School of Earth and Environmental Sciences of Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/research-students/view/1010781-smith-william) in the UK. My research focusses on the formation of magmatic and hydromagmatic ore deposits, particularly magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE sulphide deposits and granite-related W-Sn-Cu deposits. 

I am an economic geologist and researcher, with interests in magmatic and magmatic-hydrothermal ore systems. Born in Essex and raised in Cornwall (United Kingdom), I became interested in geosciences upon completion of my chemistry and geography A-levels at Callington College. I completed a Bachlors degree with honors in geology and a Masters degree in igneous petrology and ore deposit geology at the University of Portsmouth between 2013 and 2017. Following this, I went on to read for a PhD in igneous petrology and magmatic sulphide deposites at Cardiff University from 2017 to 2021. I am now...

<summary>Fieldwork Experience</summary>
<ul> During my time studying Earth sciences, I have conducted fieldwork in Europe, North America, South America, and Africa, from tundra to dessert to and tropical ecosystems. Some highlights include: </ul>
<ul>
<li> Quadrilatero Ferrifero, Brazil </li>
<li> Cornubian Batholith, Cornwall </li>
<li> Bushveld Complex, South Africa </li>
<li> Labrador Trough, Canada </li>
<li> Troodos Ophiolite, Cyprus </li>
<li> Iberian Massif, Portugal </li>
</ul>
<ul> I have experience in a variety of fieldwork methods, including: (i) traditional and digital mapping, (ii) collecting structural measurements, (iii) portable XRF, (iv) rock, channel, and soil sampling, and drill-core logging. In addition, I am proficient in ArcGIS, QGIS, and GCDKit, with a working knowledge of ioGAS, MapInfo, Leapfrog, and Micromine. </ul>

<summary>Analytical Experience</summary>
<ul> Modern research in geosciences requires a holistic and multi-scale approach to tackle unanswered questions. I have been fortunate to work in academic and commercial laboratories and currently have experience in the following methods:</ul>
<ul>
<li> Optical microscopy (transmitted and reflected light) </li>
<li> Electron microscopy (CL, BSE, SEM-EDS, SEM-WDS, EPMA, & EBSD) </li>
<li> Geochemical analysis (XRD, portable XRF, microXRF, machine XRF, ICP-MS, & LA-ICP-MS) </li>
<li> Rock crushing, mineral separation, & milling apparatus (jaw crush, disc/tema/ball mills, micromill, Frantz separator, Wilfley table, & heavy liquids) </li>
<li> Isotope geochemistry & geochronology (LA-ICP-MS, MC-ICP-MS, CA-ID-TIMS, & SIMS) </li>
</ul>
