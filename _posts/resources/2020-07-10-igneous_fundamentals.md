<ul>The <strong>igneous petrology series</strong> is a series of short and simple educational videos on topics such as thermodynamics, geochemistry, and geology. In the fundamentals playlist, I talk about thermodynamics, element classification, and phase diagrams. These can be quite complicated subjects, but once they're broken down, you'll see they are not quite as daunting as first thought! All my videos can be found here or on my <a id="raw-url" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEGIOAcUZaj2POpl_HfLJJg?view_as=subscriber">Youtube Channel!</a><ul>
