## Data collations from the Labrador Trough, Canada
  
<ul>Readers are referred to publications in my <emph>Magmatic Sulphides of the Labrador Trough</emph> section in <emph>My Research</emph> for supplementary materials that includes whole-rock geochemistry, mineral chemistry, and isotope geochemistry of the Montangias Sill Complex rocks and sulphides, as well as their country rocks.
