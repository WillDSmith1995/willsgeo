I am a geologist currently reading for a PhD in exploration geology at the [School of Earth and Environmental Sciences of Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/research-students/view/1010781-smith-william) in the UK. My research focusses on the formation of magmatic and hydromagmatic ore deposits, particularly magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE sulphide deposits and granite-related W-Sn-Cu deposits.

<summary>Fieldwork Experience</summary>
<ul> During my time studying Earth sciences, I have conducted fieldwork in Europe, North America, South America, and Africa, from tundra to dessert to and tropical ecosystems. Some highlights include: </ul>
<ul>
<li> Quadrilatero Ferrifero, Brazil </li>
<li> Cornubian Batholith, Cornwall </li>
<li> Bushveld Complex, South Africa </li>
<li> Labrador Trough, Canada </li>
<li> Troodos Ophiolite, Cyprus </li>
<li> Iberian Massif, Portugal </li>
</ul>
<ul> I have experience in a variety of fieldwork methods, including: (i) traditional and digital mapping, (ii) collecting structural measurements, (iii) portable XRF, (iv) rock, channel, and soil sampling, and drill-core logging. In addition, I am proficient in ArcGIS, QGIS, and GCDKit, with a working knowledge of ioGAS, MapInfo, Leapfrog, and Micromine. </ul>

<summary>Analytical Experience</summary>
<ul> Modern research in Earth science requires a holistic and multi-scale approach to unanswered questions. I have been fortunate to work in academic and commercial laboratories and currently have experience in the following methods:</ul>
<ul>
<li> Optical microscopy </li>
<li> Electron microscopy (SEM-EDS, SEM-WDS, & EPMA) </li>
<li> Geochemical analysis (XRD, XRF, ICP-MS, & LA-ICP-MS) </li>
<li> Rock crushing and milling apparatus </li>
<li> Isotope geochemistry (LA-ICP-MS, MC-ICP-MS, CA-ID-TIMS, & SIMS) </li>
</ul>

<summary>Memberships</summary>
<ul> Since 2016, I have been a student representative of the <a id="raw-url" href="https://www.segweb.org/">Society of Economic Geologists</a> at Cardiff University, the University of Portsmouth, and for the United Kingdom. This is a brilliant society, which has abundant useful resources, fieldtrips, and funding opportunities, together with an expansive network of students and professionals. In addition, I have been a student editor for the Applied Mineralogist of the <a id="raw-url" href="https://www.minersoc.org/amg.html">Applied Mineralogy Group</a>, which was a great way to interact with the community.</ul> 

<ul> Other societies I have been involved in include the <a id="raw-url" href="https://www.iom3.org/">Institute or Materials, Minerals & Mining (IOM3)</a>, the <a id="raw-url" href="https://geologistsassociation.org.uk/">Geologists Association</a>, the <a id="raw-url" href="https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/geochemistry">Geochemistry Group</a>, and the <a id="raw-url" href="https://www.minersoc.org/#/ms-5/2">Mineralogical Society</a>. Memberships fees for these societies are small (sometimes free for a year!) and I encourage students in Earth science subjects to join and contribute.</ul>
