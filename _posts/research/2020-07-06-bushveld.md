# Bushveld Complex

<ul> The Bushveld complex of South Africa is the world’s largest layered intrusion comprising up to 8 km of layered cumulates exposed along a strike length of around 400 km. The upper critical zone (UCZ) of the Bushveld complex consists of 500 m of interlayered mafic, ultramafic, and feldspathic rocks, forming mainly leuconorite, but also including orthopyroxenite, troctolite, harzburgite, several chromitite layers and many layers of anorthosite. The world’s richest and most extensively mined PGE reefs are located towards the top of the UCZ, namely the Merensky Reef, the UG2 chromitite, and the Platreef.

# Merensky Reef
  
<ul>The Merensky Reef of the Bushveld Complex, South Africa, hosts one of the largest platinum group element (PGE) resources globally. It has been exploited for nearly 100 years, yet its origin remains unresolved. In a forthcoming manuscript, we characterised eight samples of the reef at four localities in the western Bushveld Complex using micro-X-ray fluorescence and field emission scanning electron microscopy. Our results from a <a id="raw-url" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674987120302413">2021 publication</a> indicate that the Merensky Reef formed through a range of diverse processes.</ul>

<ul>Textures exhibited by chromite grains at the base of the reef are consistent with supercooling and <em>in situ</em> growth. The local thickening of the Merensky chromitite layers within troughs in the floor rocks is most readily explained by granular flow. Annealing and deformation textures in pyroxenes of the Merensky pegmatoid bear testament to recrystallisation and deformation. The footwall rocks to the reef contain disseminations of PGE rich sulphides as well as olivine grains with peritectic reaction rims along their upper margins suggesting reactive downward flow of silicate and sulphide melts. Olivine-hosted melt inclusions containing Cl-rich apatite, sodic plagioclase, and phlogopite suggest the presence of highly evolved, volatile-rich melts. Pervasive reverse zonation of cumulus plagioclase in the footwall of the reef indicates dissolution or partial melting of plagioclase, possibly triggered by flux of heat, acidic fluids, or hydrous melt. Together, these data suggest that the reef formed through a combination of magmatic, hydrodynamic and hydromagmatic processes.</ul>

# Mottled Anorthosites

<ul>Bushveld anorthosites commonly contain the so-called “mottles” comprising irregular, typically centimetric domains of oikocrystic pyroxene or olivine enclosing small, embayed plagioclase grains. The mottles were traditionally interpreted to result from solidification of trapped intercumulus liquid or via in situ crystallisation at the top of the crystal mush. Here, we present microtextural and compositional data of a mottle to place further constraints on the formation of anorthosite layers. Element maps generated by scanning electron microscopy reveal that plagioclase within and around the mottle has markedly elevated An contents (up to An95) relative to the host anorthosite and is strongly reversely zoned. Other unusual features, some of which were reported previously, include a halo of sub-vertically oriented, acicular phlogopite around the mottle, elevated contents of disseminated sulfides, and relatively evolved yet Ni-rich olivine (Fo71–75, 3000 ppm Ni). These features are interpreted to result from reactive porous flow of hot, acidic fluid enriched in nickel and sulfur through proto norite. The fluids dissolved mafic minerals and leached alkalis from the outer rims of plagioclase grains. Reconnaissance studies suggest that reversed zoning of plagioclase is a common feature in Bushveld norite and anorthosite. This implies that reactive porous flow could have been far more pervasive than currently realised and that Bushveld anorthosite layers formed through recrystallisation of norites.

# Boulder Bed

<ul>In the present study, we have produced a series of high-resolution element maps of the Boulder Bed of the Bushveld Complex using micro-x-ray fluorescence (XRF) and scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). The Boulder Bed (termed the “anorthosite containing nodules” or “a.c.n.” by Jones 1976) of the upper Critical zone occurs ~ 20-60 m stratigraphically below the MR in the southern portion of the western lobe of the Bushveld Complex (Jones 1976; Lee and Sharpe 1980; Maier and Barnes 2003). Lithological and petrological descriptions of the units have been given by few authors (Ferguson and Botha 1963; Cousins 1969; Van Reysen 1971; Vermaak 1976; Jones 1976; Lee and Sharpe 1980; Viljeon and Hieber 1986; Naldrett et al. 1986; Leeb-du Toit 1986; Maier and Eales 1997; Maier and Barnes 2003). The Boulder Bed represents a ~ 1-5 m layer of mottled anorthosite (described in Maier et al. 2021) comprising sub-circular “boulders” of pyroxenite, harzburgite, and less commonly norite (Maier and Barnes 2003). The mottled anorthosite (and leuconorite) is overlain and underlain by norite layers that are marked by laterally impersistent chromitite seams (Lee and Sharpe 1980). In a forthcoming manuscript, we describe petrological observations from the Boulder Bed and discuss the implications these have for the formation of this elusive unit.</ul>
