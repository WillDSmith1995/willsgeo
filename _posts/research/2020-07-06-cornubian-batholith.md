# Overview
  
<ul> Since growing up in Cornwall, I have had the opportunity to see many of Cornwall's coasts, coves, and beaches, climb many of the tors on Dartmoor, Bodmin Moor, and the other granite stocks, and visit many of the legacy and active mines that occur all over the southwest. It is for this reason I chose geology for further studies. The geology of Cornwall is perhaps some of the best known geology in the world, being studied and mined for 100s of years. A great article on the Cornish mining legacy can be found <a id="raw-url" href="https://www.cornwallheritagetrust.org/timeline/industry-in-cornwall/">here</a>.</ul>

<ul> In academic studies, my masters project was focused on disentagling bimodal granite petrogenesis in the <a id="raw-url" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornubian_batholith">Cornubian Batholith</a> (<em>Figure 1</em>) and assess the implication this may have for W-Sn-Cu mineralisation. Through this project, I have worked with companies operating on W-Sn-Cu and china clay projects and still have strong ties with Cornish operations.</ul>

## Granite petrogenesis
  
<ul>Granites across southwest England (Fig. 1) have played a significant role in the genesis of world-class polymetallic
mineralisation. In a study <a id="raw-url" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024493719301252?casa_token=1z0rqJxqGEoAAAAA:o1hfZYCTUGDBS9OS-jGe9aYFWMAMKrjjanf7nc4ydA7CtpWkPxj9vf5kaRLGu5nTrOqAXxzfiA">published in 2019</a>, we present the first geochemical and geochronological dataset for the composite Crownhill stock, placing it into the newly emerging geochronological framework for the Cornubian Batholith. The Crownhill stock comprises two-mica granite in the north and biotite granite in the south that encloses pods of tourmaline granite. High-resolution geochronology indicated two-phase magmatism (<em>Figure 2</em>), where zircon cores yield 288.9 &plusmn; 5 Ma and 286.4 &plusmn; 5 Ma and rims yield 277.74 &plusmn; 0.33 Ma and 278.35 &plusmn; 0.35 Ma, for biotite and tourmaline granite, respectively (Fig, 2). The zircon cores crystallised during initial magmatism, that formed the two-mica and muscovite granites (Carnmenellis, Bodmin, and Hemerdon) exposed in the north of the Crownhill stock. The zircon rims crystallised from the second phase of magmatism that formed the biotite and tourmaline granites (Dartmoor and St. Austell). This indicates that zircon crystals were assimilated from older two-mica and muscovite granites and entrained in the second phase of magmatism. Trace element compositions of zircon grains suggest that the rims crystallised from a more evolved magma, where zircon grains hosted in tourmaline granites are broadly more evolved than those from biotite granites.</ul>

## W-Sn-Cu mineralisation
  
<ul>Granite plutons and stocks of the Cornubian Batholith are known for world-class W-Sn mineralisation, which typically manifests itself as greisen-bordered stockworks (such as Hemerdon and Cligga Head) or as polymetallic lode systems that protrude from granites (such as those in the Camborne-Redruth area and Redmoor). I have been part of a geological team working on deciphering the formation of world-class grisen-bordered tungsten stockworks at Hemerdon (Drakeland's Mine) located south of the Dartmoor pluton. </ul>

<ul>Since 2016, I have been involved in exploration at the <a id="raw-url" href="https://www.cornwallresources.com/the-redmoor-project">Redmoor W-Sn-Cu prospect</a> located in Callington (the lodes actually run underneath my childhood home!). Of note at Redmoor, is the W-Sn-Cu-bearing sheeted vein system that apparently protrudes westward from the local Kit Hill granite (Fig. 3). Readers are referred to the link above for details on the Redmoor prospect direct from the source! I was involved in logging core, organising the drill programmes, and interpreting the geology of the region during an internship with Cornwall Resources (the onsite company at Redmoor). Furthermore, I co-supervised a Masters project at the University of Portsmouth that aimed to revise the paragenesis of the Redmoor lodes using optical and electron microscopy, mineral chemistry, and Pb isotopes.</ul>
