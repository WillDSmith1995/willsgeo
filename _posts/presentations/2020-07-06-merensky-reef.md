# Summary

<ul> This presentation describes element maps of the Merensky Reef sampled from the Rustenburg and Northam mines in the western lobe of the Bushveld Complex, South Africa. My colleagues and I share some microXRF and FESEM-EDS element maps highlighting a range of microscopic features. We state that there is evidence for magmatic, hydromagmatic, and hydrodynamic processes that operated in tandem to form the spectacular Merensky Reef. This presentation was given at PGE day of the Geological Survey of South Africa in 2020 and at the virtual Nickel Symposium in 2020.</ul>
