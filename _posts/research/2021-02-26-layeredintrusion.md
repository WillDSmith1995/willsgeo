# Global layered intrusions and their mineral inventory

<ul> In the present paper, we have compiled data on 612 layered igneous intrusions globally, documenting their (i) location, (ii) age, (iii) size, (iv) geotectonic setting, (v) putative parent magma(s), (vi) crystallisation sequence, and (vii) mineral deposits. Most known layered intrusions occur in Russia (126), Australia (71), Canada (65), China (42), Finland (39), South Africa (38), and Brazil (32). Notable clusters of: (i) Archaean intrusions (~ 11%) include those of the Ring of Fire (Canada), Pilbara and Yilgarn cratons (Australia), and Barberton (South Africa); (ii) Proterozoic intrusions (~ 25%) include those of the Giles Event and Halls Creek Orogen (Australia), Kaapvaal craton and its margin (South Africa and Botswana), Kola and Karelia cratons (Finland and Russia), and Midcontinent Rift (Canada and USA); and (iii) Phanerozoic intrusions (~ 41%) include those of eastern Greenland, the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (China and Mongolia) and Emeishan large igneous province (China). Throughout geological time, the occurrence of layered intrusions correlates with the amalgamation of supercontinents, yet the size and mineral inventory of intrusions shows no obvious secular changes.</ul> 

<ul> In our compilation, 316 intrusions possess one or more types of mineral occurrences, including: (i) 100 with stratiform PGE reef-style mineralisation, (ii) 143 with Ni-Cu-(PGE) contact-style mineralisation, (iii) 67 with stratiform Fe-Ti-V-(P) horizons, and (iv) â‰¥ 35 with chromitite seams. Sill-like or chonolithic layered intrusions present in extensional tectonic settings and spanning geological time are most prospective for Ni-Cu-(PGE) mineralisation. In contrast, PGE reef-style deposits are most prevalent in larger, commonly lopolithic intrusions that are generally > 1 Ga in age (~ 75%). Stratiform Fe-Ti-V-(P) horizons are most common in the central and upper portions of larger layered intrusions, occurring in the Archaean and Phanerozoic. Approximately 80% of intrusions with chromitite seams are older than 1 Ga and > 50% of them also contain PGE reefs.</ul>
