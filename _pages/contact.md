I am a geologist currently reading for a PhD in exploration geology at the [School of Earth and Environmental Sciences of Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/research-students/view/1010781-smith-william) in the UK. My research focusses on the formation of magmatic and hydromagmatic ore deposits, particularly magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE sulphide deposits and granite-related W-Sn-Cu deposits.
