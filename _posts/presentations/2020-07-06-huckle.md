# Summary

<ul>This poster summarises some results from the portion of my PhD project that focusses on the formation of the Huckleberry prospect and its implications for regional prospectivity. These presentations focus on the chalcophile element distribution in different styles of sulphide mineralisation at the prospect. An ore genesis model is proposed and described. Two posters were perenseted, one at the Granites workshop held in Brittany in 2019 and another at the SGA biennial meeting held in Glasgow in 2019.</ul>
