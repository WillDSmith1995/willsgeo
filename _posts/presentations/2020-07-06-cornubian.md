# Summary
  
<ul>This poster summarises the geochemical and geochonological results from my masters project focused on disentangling bimodal granite magmatism of the Cornubian Batholith in southwest England. I present a hypothesis that a portion of 'magmatic zircon' in second-phase granite magmatism are infact antecrysts from older, crystallised granites. The implication is that initial-stage granite magmatism may be more widespread than previously thought, which has either been subject to erosion, has not yet been exposed, or is masked by second-phase granite magmatism. This poster was presentated at the Mineral Deposit Studies Group Annual Meeting in 2018.</ul>
