# Overview

<ul> My PhD project aims to better constrain the formation of magmatic Cu-Ni-(PGE) and PGE-Cu sulphide deposits in the Labrador Trough, NE Canada. I am applying a holistic and multi-scale approach to identify the processes that are major, minor, and detrimental for ore genesis in the region. This project is in collaboration with <a id="raw-url" href="http://northern-shield.com/">Northern Shield Resources</a>.</ul>

<ul> The Labrador Trough in northern Quebec, Canada, is a site of ongoing exploration for magmatic sulphide deposits. The region is considered prospective for magmatic sulphide ores, since it is host to voluminous mafic-ultramafic rocks that occur in proximity to trans-crustal faults and sulphidic supracrustal rocks. The location, tectonic structure, and major mineral occurrences of the Labrador Trough are shown in <em>Figure 1</em>. </ul>

## The Idefix PGE-Cu prospect

<ul>The <a id="raw-url" href="http://northern-shield.com/idefix-ni-cu-pge-labrador-trough-quebec/">Idefix PGE-Cu prospect</a>
(<em>Figure 2</em>) represents a &gt;400-m-thick stack of aphyric mesogabbroic sills that host stratiform disseminated sulphides (&#126; 0.2 to 0.4 g/t Pt+Pd+Au) over a thickness of &#126; 20 m, for up to  km. In addition, globular sulphides occur at the base of the sill, adjacent to metasedimentary floor rocks. Whole-rock lithophile and chalcophile element geochemistry indicates that the sills share a common source and that the magma(s) underwent significant fractionation before emplacement in the upper crust. To develop PGE-enriched sulphides, sulphide melt saturation was attained before the final emplacement of the host magma, peaking at <em>R</em> factors of	&#126; 10,000. The globular sulphides were entrained along the base of the sill, where they ingested crustally-derived arsenic and sulphur.</ul>

<ul>This occurrence highlights the challenges explorationists face in determining way-up of aphyric mesogabbro sills. Where whole-rock and mineral geochemistry prove ineffective (since mafic-ultramafic sills have the tendency to display what is known as geochemical reversals), geologists must search for way-up structures, perhaps located in the supracrustal country rock. In a <a id="raw-url" href="https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/cjes-2019-0137#.XwLxSCi2ncs">2020 publication</a>, we propose several scenarios (<em>Figure 3</em>) for the formation of the Idefix PGE-Cu prospect and outline the implications this has for regional prospectivity.</ul>

## The Huckleberry Cu-Ni-PGE prospect

<ul>The <a id="raw-url" href="http://northern-shield.com/huckleberry-ni-cu-pge-labrador-trough-quebec/">Huckleberry PGE-Cu prospect</a> (<em>Figure 4</em>) represents a 200-m-thick stack of glomeroporphyritic gabbro sills intruded in their centre by a 200-m-thick gabbro-peridotite sill. In addition, several &lt;30-m-thick olivine cumulate protrusions occur in the glomeroporphyritic gabbro footwall to the gabbro-peridotite sill. Globular sulphides occur at the base of the sill complex, and return peak grades of 0.36% Cu, 0.1% Ni, and 0.06 g/t Pt+Pd+Au over around 4 m. Net-textured sulphides occur in the peritotitic base of the gabbro-peridotite sill, within the glomeroporphyritic gabbro footwall, and within footwall olivine cumulate sills in the footwall. Grades between the three disseminated to net-textured occurrences vary only slightly, returning 0.12-0.36% Cu, 0.09-0.2% Ni, and 0.14-0.41 g/t Pd+Pd+Au.</ul>

<ul>It is proposed that the glomerocrysts represent remobilised mush dislodged from a flotation cumulate in a staging chamber during episodic expulsion of magma. Whole-rock geochemistry and mineral compositions of the gabbro-peridotite and footwall olivine cumulate sills suggest that they share a common source and that they underwent minor degrees of pre-emplacement fractionation. Chalcophile element geochemistry suggests that the parent magma attained sulphide saturation prior to its final emplacement at relatively low <em>R</em> factors (&lt;5,000). It is proposed that fractionated sulphide melt was entrained during emplacement of the gabbro-peridotite sill, which split the antecedent glomeroporphyritic gabbro sill into two. Sulphide melt percolated downward through the peridotitic cumulate pile and extended downward into the glomeroporphyritic gabbro footwall. The footwall olivine cumulate sills may represent downward injections of olivine and sulphide melt from the overlying gabbro-peridotite sill along contacts between individual glomeroporphyritic gabbro sills intersected by erosional troughs formed during the emplacement of the gabbro-peridotite sill (<em>Figure 5</em>). Further detail on the Huckleberry prospect can be found in a <a id="raw-url" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169136820310908">2021 publication</a>.</ul>

## Ongoing work

<ul> The distribution of chalcophile and siderophile elements among six styles of magmatic sulphide mineralisation in the Montagnais Sill Complex has been characterised using detailed mineralogical work combined with laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry trace element analysis of sulphides. We show that assemblages are dominated by pyrrhotite, pentlandite, and chalcopyrite, with accessory troilite, cubanite, mackinawite, and sulpharsenides. Net-textured and disseminated sulphides comprise platinum group mineral assemblages dominated by tellurides, electrum, and arsenide phases, that typically occur at silicate-sulphide grain boundaries. Pentlandite, sulpharsenides, and PGM are the most important hosts of platimin group elements. Further detail can be found in a forthcoming 2021 publication in the Canadian Mineralogist special issue in honour of the late Tony Naldrett.</ul>

<ul> The interaction between mafic-ultramafic magma and crustal sulphide is considered a key process in the formation of magmatic Ni-Cu-PGE sulphide deposits. Integrated S/Se and multiple sulphur isotope studies are the most robust in constraining the role of crustal sulphur during ore genesis. We present the first integrated S/Se and multiple sulphur isotope study of magmatic sulphide occurrences in the Labrador Trough. S/Se values if sulphides and their host rocks are consistent with S loss during post-magmatic hydrothermal alteration, negating their use in interpreting the origin of S. The sulphur isotope signatures show no Archaean sulphur was assimilated, but that sulphides at Idefix and Huckleberry formed in response to the assimilation of small proportions of crustal sulphur, perhaps in a feeder conduit or staging chamber. Isotopic exchange between the sulphide melt and silicate magma has diluted and in places eradicated a crustal signature. Further detail can be found in a forthcoming 2021 publication in Economic Geology.</ul>

<ul> Resistant indicator minerals (RIMs) are widely used in the early stages of exploration for a range of commodities to delineate areas of heightened prospectivity. We intend to characterise apatite and Fe-Ti oxides hosted in mineralised and barren units to test their application as RIMs in the Labrador Trough.</ul>
