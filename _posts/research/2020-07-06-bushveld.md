# Overview
  
<ul>The Merensky Reef of the Bushveld Complex, South Africa, hosts one of the largest platinum group element (PGE) resources globally. It has been exploited for nearly 100 years, yet its origin remains unresolved. In a forthcoming manuscript, we characterised eight samples of the reef at four localities in the western Bushveld Complex using micro-X-ray fluorescence and field emission scanning electron microscopy. Our results from this study indicate that the Merensky Reef formed through a range of diverse processes.</ul>

<ul>Textures exhibited by chromite grains at the base of the reef are consistent with supercooling and <em>in situ</em> growth. The local thickening of the Merensky chromitite layers within troughs in the floor rocks is most readily explained by granular flow. Annealing and deformation textures in pyroxenes of the Merensky pegmatoid bear testament to recrystallisation and deformation. The footwall rocks to the reef contain disseminations of PGE rich sulphides as well as olivine grains with peritectic reaction rims along their upper margins suggesting reactive downward flow of silicate and sulphide melts. Olivine-hosted melt inclusions containing Cl-rich apatite, sodic plagioclase, and phlogopite suggest the presence of highly evolved, volatile-rich melts. Pervasive reverse zonation of cumulus plagioclase in the footwall of the reef indicates dissolution or partial melting of plagioclase, possibly triggered by flux of heat, acidic fluids, or hydrous melt. Together, these data suggest that the reef formed through a combination of magmatic, hydrodynamic and hydromagmatic processes.</ul>

<ul>Academic study is ongoing, we intend to continue to delve deeper into the microstructural features of the Merensky Reef and other key horizons in the Rustenberg Suite of the Bushveld Complex. This layered intrusion is a natural laboratory for igneous and ore-forming processes and much remains to be uncovered from this remarkable structure.</ul>
