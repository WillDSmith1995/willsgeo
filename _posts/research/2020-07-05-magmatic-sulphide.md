# Overview

<ul> My PhD project aims to better constrain the formation of magmatic Cu-Ni-(PGE) and PGE-Cu sulphide deposits in the Labrador Trough, NE Canada. I am applying a holistic and multi-scale approach to identify the processes that are major, minor, and detrimental for ore genesis in the region. This project is in collaboration with <a id="raw-url" href="http://northern-shield.com/">Northern Shield Resources</a>.</ul>

<ul> The Labrador Trough in northern Quebec, Canada, is a site of ongoing exploration for magmatic sulphide deposits. The region is considered prospective for magmatic sulphide ores, since it is host to voluminous mafic-ultramafic rocks that occur in proximity to trans-crustal faults and sulphidic supracrustal rocks. The location, tectonic structure, and major mineral occurrences of the Labrador Trough are shown in <em>Figure 1</em>. </ul>

## The Idefix PGE-Cu prospect

<ul>The <a id="raw-url" href="http://northern-shield.com/idefix-ni-cu-pge-labrador-trough-quebec/">Idefix PGE-Cu prospect</a>
(<em>Figure 2</em>) represents a &gt;400-m-thick stack of aphyric mesogabbroic sills that host stratiform patchy disseminated to net-textured sulphides (&#126; 0.2 to 0.4 g/t PGE+Au) over a thickness of &#126; 20 m, for up to  km. In addition, globular sulphides occur at the base of the sill, adjacent to metasedimentary floor rocks. Whole-rock lithophile and chalcophile element geochemistry indicates that the sills share a common source and that the magma(s) underwent significant fractionation before emplacement in the upper crust. To develop PGE-enriched ores, sulphide melt saturation was attained before the final emplacement of the host magma, peaking at <em>R</em> factors of	&#126; 10,000. The globular sulphides were entrained along the base of the sill, where they ingested crustally-derived arsenic and sulphur.</ul>

<ul>This occurrence highlights the challenges explorationists face in determining way-up of aphyric mesogabbro sills. Where whole-rock and mineral geochemistry prove ineffective (since mafmatic-ultramafic sills have the tendency to display what is known as geochemical reversals), geologists must search for way-up structures, perhaps located in the supracrustal country rock. In a <a id="raw-url" href="https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/cjes-2019-0137#.XwLxSCi2ncs">recent publication</a>, we propose several scenarios (<em>Figure 3</em>) for the formation of the Idefix PGE-Cu prospect and outline the implications this has for regional prospectivity.</ul>

## The Huckleberry Cu-Ni-PGE prospect

<ul>The <a id="raw-url" href="http://northern-shield.com/huckleberry-ni-cu-pge-labrador-trough-quebec/">Huckleberry PGE-Cu prospect</a> (<em>Figure 4</em>) represents a 200-m-thick stack of glomeroporphyritic gabbro sills intruded in their centre by a 200-m-thick gabbro-wehrlite sill. In addition, several &lt;30-m-thick websterite protrusions occur in the glomeroporphyritic gabbro footwall to the gabbro-wehrlite sill. Globular sulphides occur at the base of the sill complex, and return peak grades of 0.36% Cu, 0.1% Ni, and 0.06 g/t 2PGE+Au over around 4 m. Patchy net-textured sulphides occur in the wehrlitic base of the gabbro-wehrlite sill, within the glomeroporphyritic gabbro footwall, and within websterite sills in the footwall. Grades between the three disseminated to net-textured occurrences vary only slightly, returning 0.12-0.36% Cu, 0.09-0.2% Ni, and 0.14-0.41 g/t 2PGE+Au.</ul>

<ul>It is proposed that the glomerocrysts represent remobilised mush dislodged from a flotation cumulate in a staging chamber during episodic expulsion of magma. Whole-rock geochemistry and mineral compositions of the gabbro-wehrlite and websterite sills suggest that they share a common source and that they underwent minor degrees of pre-emplacement fractionation. Chalcophile element geochemistry suggests that the parent magma attained sulphide saturation prior to its final emplacement at relatively low <em>R</em> factors (&lt;5,000). It is proposed that fractionated sulphide melt was entrained during emplacement of the gabbro-wehrlite sill, which split the antecedent glomeroporphyritic gabbro sill into two. Sulphide percolated downward through the wehrlite cumulate pile and extended downward into the glomeroporphyritic gabbro footwall. The websterite sills may represent downward injections of olivine and sulphide melt from the overlying gabbro-wehrlite sill along contacts between individual glomeroporphyritic gabbro sills intersected by erosional troughs formed during the emplacement of the gabbro-wehrlite sill (<em>Figure 5</em>). A manuscript detailing the formation of this prospect is forthcoming and a link will be shared here when it is available online.</ul>

## Ongoing work

<ul> In addition to forensic studies on contrasting sulphide occurrences, I intend to evaluate the depositional mechanisms of sulphide melt, assess the role of crustal assimilation for different styles of magmatic sulphide occurrence, and produce mineral prospectivity maps of the Labrador Trough. This study incorporates physical, analytical, and computed methods to assess whether world-class magmatic sulphide mineralisation is hidden somewhere in the Labrador Trough.
